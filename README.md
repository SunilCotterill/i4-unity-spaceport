## Description
A 3d simulation of a factory in space that is responsible for processing solid, liquid and gas capsules through various stations. 
The simulation is used for the Industry 4.0 competition, which is a competition for high school students related to management
engineering concepts and supply chain processes. To learn more, visit our [website](https://www.i4competition.ca)

## Project Details
- Uses the Unity Game Engine with C# to create a simulation driven by a finite state machine
- User can modify simulation speeds and move around the factory
- pressing p brings up settings and controls in the pause menu
